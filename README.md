The files here contain information for the execution of the DoAFedP-NN algorithm.

This is a federated learning algorithm for the model development of non-IID medical signal data.
Specifically developed for EEG based DoA analysis.

This work supports the methods published by Thomas Schmierer at UniSQ in "Advancing DoA Assessment through Federated Learning: A One-shot Pseudo Data Approach"
